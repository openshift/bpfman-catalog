# WARNING: This template currently contains a pre-release development bundle (v0.5.7-dev).
#
# This was populated to enable pipeline configuration testing, as the OPM validation
# step requires at least one bundle entry in the channel. An empty released.yaml
# causes the build to fail with "channel must contain at least one bundle".
#
# DO NOT create a Konflux release from this until the bundle is updated to a
# production-ready version (e.g., v0.5.7 GA without the -dev suffix).
#
# To update to a production bundle when available:
#   make final-ystream BUNDLE_SHA=<production-bundle-digest>
